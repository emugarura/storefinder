#What is this?
I created a fictitious Store Finder webapp that makes use of Angular Google Maps API

#What does it do?
A lot of cool stuff! Such as:
- Show all the stores in the map with custom icons based on a given json
- Cluster the stores into groups, based on the zoom level
- Apply filters
- Panels showing the store info on events
- Autosearch, Get Current Location, etc.
- Etc

#Technologies
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org)
- [Angular Google Maps API](http://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/)
- [Angular Google Places Autocomplete](https://github.com/kuhnza/angular-google-places-autocomplete)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)


#What about the data?
The app provides a json dummy data with all the stores info. If you want to use your own data, go ahead: You have to either replace the local json for yours or just change the URL in the GET method to call an API Rest (most likely).
